VERSION 1.0.0 (2014-12-02)

- Very radical change on the package introducing incompatibilities with 
  the version 0.x.y versions. A kind of fresh new re-start for the

- Far too many changes to be written here. You are strongly advised to 
  check the included package vignette to check the new way the package 
  works.
